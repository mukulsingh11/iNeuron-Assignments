        "Answer:\n",
        "Python provides a generator to create your own iterator function. A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.\n",

        "Generator functions provide a powerful alternative: they allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous. Generator functions are written using the function* syntax. When called, generator functions do not initially execute their code.\n"

        "The yield statement suspends a function's execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable the function to resume where it left off. When the function resumes, it continues execution immediately after the last yield run.The yield statement returns a generator object to the one who calls the function which contains yield, instead of simply returning a value.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        "List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required).Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined as a function earlier."
